            keep track of the actual fish in the pond

            debating canvas vs html

            need a pond, which has a shape. we need to be able to tell if a
            point is in or out of the pond.

            we need fish. schools of fish. finite, countable fish in a pond.
            fish move around. perhaps they will be cellular atomata and do
            schooling behavior. that might be fun. we could do all kinds of
            tricky things, like bass like deep, shaded water, perch like
            to be near the surface in reedy places, etc. that ai behavior would
            be a fun project all in itself.

            so maybe a fish object, with keys of fish type (bass, trout, ...),
            value of an array of that type of fish.

            also, some spiffy data structure to store the location of 
            everything, which will facilitate sensibly asking "what is near 
            this?" store coordinants and object referance in the structure.

            so when a baited hook is at (x,y), we ask the data struc what fish
            are within d distance of (x,y), and check each one of them against
            the bait type to see if there is a strike.

            what is it that makes a fish behave?
            perhaps a fish has some certain radius of perception, and it is
            influenced by things it percieves. other fish of its species, bait,
            environmental stuff like depth, foliage, etc.

            do all fish of a species behave the same way, or do we stick this
            sort of thing into each fish, so they could even learn (like the 
            bigger it gets, the less likely it is to bite on bait)?

            probably take the easy way to begin, and make a behavior function
            per species. probably a closure factory that takes the particulars
            for a species and returns a function that pertains to it.
